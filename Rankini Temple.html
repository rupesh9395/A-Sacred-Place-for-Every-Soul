           <h2>History</h2>
           It is said about Maa Rankini temple that Goddess Rankini is seated in a stone and is still awake today. Rankini Temple was established during 1947-50, at present, the place where the mother is worshipped has been established. Mata Rankini used to reside in the Kapadgadi valley situated next to the drain passing below the main temple. Mother was in the form of a stone in a bond. It is said that Goddess Rankini came in a dream to a person named Dinbandhu Singh and told about herself being in the form of a stone. The Goddess also told in his dream that she needs worship and he would worship her. From that day onwards, Dinbandhu Singh started worshipping in that rock with vermilion and a colored cloth. A few years after that, the mother gave a divine dream to Dinbandhu and asked him to establish a place where the general public could also reach and worship Mata Rankini.

           <h2>Story</h2>
           Goddess Rankini used to live in the forests in the Kapadgadi Valley. One day a shepherd, seeing a girl walking alone in the forest, started asking about her. But the girl did not answer. To escape from the shepherd, she reached Kapadgadi Ghat, where a washer-man was washing clothes. She went inside his cloth bag and hid. After a while, when the shepherd could not find the girl, he returned to the forest. In the meantime, the pile of clothes in which the Goddess was hiding had turned into stone

           <h2>Temple</h2>
           The Goddess worshipped in the temple is believed to be a physical incarnation of Goddess Kali. The ancient temple is said to have formerly existed on a rock. According to the legends, the temple had witnessed the human sacrifices (narabali) in the past, until about 1865, when this was eventually stopped by the British. The belief amongst the tribes was that the Goddess herself killed the victims. The stone deity was originally worshipped by the local Bhumij tribes. Later, through the passage of time this worship transformed into worship of the Hindu Goddess Durga, probably when the Kings of Dhalbhumgarh took over. Dhalbhum was first written about when the British Army attacked the Dhalbhum and Ghatsila region in 1767 jointly with Raja of Midnapore, after a previous abortive attempt in 1765.[8] The famous Bengali writer Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay (1894-1950) has mentioned Rankini Devi in his Bengali story named "Rankini Debir Khadga
