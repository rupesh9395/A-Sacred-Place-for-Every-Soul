  <h1>Ramappa Temple (Rudreshwara Temple)</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Ramappa Temple, officially known as Rudreshwara Temple, is a magnificent 13th-century Hindu temple located in Palampet village, Mulugu district, Telangana. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, it is celebrated for its intricate carvings, floating bricks, and unique architectural brilliance. In 2021, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, making it the first temple in India named after its sculptor—Ramappa.
  </p>

  <h2>Location and Geography</h2>
  <p>
    The temple is nestled near the serene Ramappa Lake, surrounded by lush greenery and tranquil landscapes. It lies approximately 66 km from Warangal and 209 km from Hyderabad. The peaceful environment enhances the spiritual experience for visitors and pilgrims alike.

  <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
  <p>
    Ramappa Temple was constructed around 1213 CE during the reign of the Kakatiya King Ganapati Deva. The temple was built under the supervision of his chief commander, Recherla Rudra. Despite centuries of invasions and natural wear, the temple stands as a testament to the resilience and artistic excellence of the Kakatiya dynasty.
  </p>

  <h2>Legend and Naming</h2>
  <p>
    Uniquely, the temple is named after its sculptor, Ramappa, rather than the deity it houses. This rare honor reflects the exceptional craftsmanship and vision of the artisan. According to legend, Marco Polo, upon visiting the Kakatiya empire, described Ramappa Temple as “the brightest star in the galaxy of temples.”
  </p>

  <h2>Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    Built in the Kakatiya style, the temple stands on a 6-foot-high star-shaped platform. The main sanctum (garbhagriha) is flanked by an antarala and a maha mandapam. The temple features large brackets carved from black basalt, depicting mythical animals, dancers, and musicians in sensuous postures. The roof is constructed using lightweight bricks that can float on water—a marvel of ancient engineering.
  </p>

  <h2>Deity and Worship</h2>
  <p>
    The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Ramalingeshwara Swamy. Daily rituals include abhishekam, archana, and deepa aradhana. The temple follows traditional Shaivite customs and attracts devotees from across India, especially during Maha Shivaratri.
  </p>

  <h2>UNESCO World Heritage Status</h2>
  <p>
    In July 2021, Ramappa Temple was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name “Kakatiya Rudreshwara (Ramappa) Temple.” It was recognized for its cultural significance, architectural innovation, and historical value. This designation has brought global attention to the temple and boosted heritage tourism in the region.
  </p>

  <h2>Restoration Efforts</h2>
