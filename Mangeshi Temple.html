            <h2>History</h2>
            This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in Mormug√£o which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in mormugao taluka, the Saraswats of Kaundinya Gotra and Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Aghanashini (Zuari) (Sancoale) to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja Taluka, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure
            <br><br><br>
            Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and again in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha (holy vessel) was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple
            <br><br><br>
            The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The Peshwas donated the village of Mangeshi to the temple in 1739 on the suggestion of their Sardar, Shri Ramchandra Malhar Sukhtankar, who was a staunch follower of Shri Mangesh. 
            <br><br><br>
            Just a few years after it was built, this area too fell into Portuguese hands in 1763,[5] but by now, the Portuguese had lost their initial religious zeal and had been repeatedly defeated by the Marathas and had become quite tolerant of other religions, and so, this structure remained untouched.

            <br>
            The main temple is dedicated to Bhagavan Manguesh, an incarnation of Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga. According to the legend, Shiva had manifested into a tiger to scare his wife Parvati.
            <br><br><br>
            Paravati, who was frightened at the sight of the tiger, went in search of Shiva and cried out, "Trahi Mam girisha!" (Oh Lord of Mountains, save me!). Upon hearing the words, Shiva turned himself back to his normal form. The words "mam girisha" became associated with Shiva and over time the words got abbreviated to Manguirisha or Manguesh.
