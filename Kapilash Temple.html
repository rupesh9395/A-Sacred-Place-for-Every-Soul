            Patita pavana Jagannath is installed in the temple as the Parsa Deva. Lord Vishwanath temple is also situated in Kapilash. According to some scholars this temple is older than the Chandrasekhar temple, hence it is known as Budha Linga. There are many legends about Kapilash pitha and its significance. Tradition describes it as the ashram of Kapila, to some scholars it is the second Kailash of Lord Shiva. Shridhar Swami who wrote commentary on Bhagavata Purana stayed there. There are some monasteries in the premises.
