  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Meenakshi Amman Temple, located in the ancient city of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, is one of the most iconic and revered temples in India. Dedicated to Goddess Meenakshi (a form of Parvati) and her consort Lord Sundareswarar (Shiva), the temple is a vibrant center of Tamil culture, spirituality, and architectural brilliance.

  <h2>Location</h2>

  <h2>Historical Background</h2>

  <h2>Legend of Meenakshi</h2>
  <p>
    According to legend, King Malayadwaja Pandya and Queen Kanchanamalai performed a yajna to be blessed with a child. From the sacrificial fire emerged a three-breasted girl, Meenakshi. A divine voice instructed that her third breast would disappear when she met her future husband. She grew up to be a warrior queen and met Lord Shiva in battle. Upon seeing him, her third breast vanished, and she realized he was her destined consort.
