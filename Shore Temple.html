           <h2>Shore Temple</h2>
           <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The Shore Temple is a stunning example of early South Indian temple architecture, located in Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu. Built during the 8th century by the Pallava dynasty, it stands as a testament to India's rich cultural and maritime heritage.
</p>

<h2>Location and Geography</h2>
<p>
  Situated on the Coromandel Coast along the Bay of Bengal, the temple overlooks the sea and is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram." Its coastal placement once served as a landmark for ancient seafarers.
</p>

<h2>Historical Background</h2>
<p>
  Constructed under the reign of King Narasimhavarman II (also known as Rajasimha), the Shore Temple marks a shift from rock-cut architecture to structural temples made of granite blocks. It was part of a larger complex, with legends suggesting six other temples now submerged under the sea.
</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>
  The temple complex consists of three shrines—two dedicated to Lord Shiva and one to Lord Vishnu. The Vishnu shrine, nestled between the Shiva temples, is the oldest and smallest. The temple's pyramidal structure and intricate carvings reflect the Dravidian style, with motifs of lions, elephants, and deities adorning its walls.
</p>

<h2>Deity and Worship</h2>
<p>
  The temple enshrines Lord Shiva in the form of a linga and Lord Vishnu in a reclining posture. Though no longer used for daily worship, it remains a sacred site and a symbol of devotion and artistry.
</p>

<h2>UNESCO Recognition</h2>
<p>
  In 1984, the Shore Temple was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its historical and architectural significance. It is one of the oldest structural stone temples in South India.
</p>

<h2>Legends and Mythology</h2>
<p>
  The temple is often associated with the legend of the "Seven Pagodas," a term coined by European sailors who believed that seven temples once stood along the coast. The 2004 tsunami revealed submerged structures nearby, lending credence to this myth.
</p>

<h2>Environmental Impact and Preservation</h2>
<p>
  The temple has withstood centuries of sea erosion and natural disasters, including the 2004 tsunami. Conservation efforts by the Archaeological Survey of India aim to preserve its structure and surroundings.
</p>

<h2>Visitor Experience</h2>
