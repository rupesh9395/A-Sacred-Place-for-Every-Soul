            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is one of the most sacred and wealthiest Hindu temples in the world. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his Ananthasayanam (eternal yogic sleep) posture, it is revered as one of the 108 Divya Desams in the Vaishnava tradition.
