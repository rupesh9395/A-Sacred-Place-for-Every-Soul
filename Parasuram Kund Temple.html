            <h2>History</h2>
            In the picturesque hills of Aravali, the Parshuram Mahadev Cave temple was built by Parshuram himself by cutting the rock with his axe. To reach this cave temple, you have to travel 500 steps. Inside this cave temple, there is a self-geographical location where Parshuram, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu, had performed rigorous penance for many years of Lord Shiva. On the basis of austerity, he had received Dhanush, Akshay Tumar and Divya Charias from Lord Shiva.
            <br><br><br>
            The surprising thing is that the entire cave remains in the same rock. The pattern above is like the cow's thong. Natural self-geographical goofing is made right above the gender, from which there is continuous natural burning on Shivling. It is believed that Lord Parshuram, who was made under the main Shivling, had ever had austerity on Shiva's harsh penance. In this cave, the shape of a monster remains on a rock. Parasurama was struck by his fists.
            <br><br><br>
            According to a belief associated with this place, Lord Badrinath's cupboard can open the same person who has visited Parshuram Mahadev.
            <br><br><br>
            Another validation cave temple is associated with Swith Shivaling. There is a hole in the Cave Shivalinga in the temple, which is believed to be that the milk does not fall into the hole by milking it, even if it does not fill hundreds of water, Gets involved in At this place Parshuram had taught Danir Karna.
