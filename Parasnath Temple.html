            <h2>Parasnath Temple</h2>
        <br>
        Parasnath Hill (also Sammet Shikhar, Marang Buru) is a mountain peak in the Parasnath hill range. It is located towards the eastern end of the Chota Nagpur Plateau in the Giridih district (Hazaribagh district in British India) of the Indian state of Jharkhand, India. <br><br>The hill is named after Parshvanatha, the 23rd Jain Tirthankara who got salvation here.[5] In this connection, there is Jain pilgrimage Shikharji on the top of hill. The hill is also known as Sammet Shikhar (lit. 'great mountain', the supreme deity) by other autochthonous of the region in religious contexts

        <h2>History</h2>
        Historically parasnath or sammed shikharji is an ancient Jain pilgrimage site it is a place where the 23rd tirthankara Parshwanath(also known as Parasnath) attained salvation here in 772 BCE. <br><br> It is noteworthy that the name of the Parasnath hill derived from the Jain Tirthankar Parshvanath who is also known as Parasnath or Parsva who attained salvation here during the 8th century BCE. After preaching for 70 years, Parshvanath attained moksha at Shikharji on Parasnath hill.Some jain texts name the place as Mount Sammeta.[8] It is revered in Jainism because 20 of its 24 tirthankars are believed to have attained moksha there. <br><br>
        At the age of 100 on Shravana Shukla Saptami according to Lunar Calendar.[12] His moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death) in Jain tradition[13] is celebrated as Moksha Saptami. This day is celebrated on large scale at Parasnath tonk of the mountain, in northern Jharkhand, part of the Parasnath Range[14] by offering Nirvana Laddu (Sugar balls) and reciting of Nirvana Kanda. Parshvanatha has been called purisādāṇīya (beloved of the people) by Jains
        <br><br>
        The Santhal community use the name Marang Buru. They are in dispute with the Jain community as to certain ancestral worship and other rights, and these have been subject to judicial review historically.[2] Recent bans on meat and alcohol, upheld by the Jharkhand High Court in 2025, have exacerbated the conflict, curtailing Santal traditions and fueling protests and counter-petitions in the court.[18] However Jains claim that santhal claim is implausible and illogical and that actually parasnath is a jain pilgrimage since ancient times.  <br><br>They also believe that Jains and Adivasis have co-existed at Parasnath Hill since ancient times, and that when the tirthankaras sought nirvana there, Adivasis traditionally carried them to the summit, a practice that continues today. <br><br> The earliest literary reference to Shikharji(Parasnath) as a tirth (place of pilgrimage) is found in the Jñātṛdhārmakātha, one of the twelve core texts of Jainism compiled in 6th century BCE by chief disciple of Mahavira. Shikharji is also mentioned in the Pārśvanāthacarita, a twelfth-century biography of Pārśva. A 13th century CE palm-leaf manuscript of Kalpa Sūtra and Kalakacaryakatha has an image of a scene of Parshavanatha's nirvana at Shikharji.[19] This all indicates Parasnath was a jain site since ancient times. Also many historians accept parasnath as the place of Moksh kalyanak(during 772 BCE) of the historical figure Tirthankar Parshvanath
