  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Ramanathaswamy Temple, located on Rameswaram Island in Tamil Nadu, is one of the most sacred Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples and a key site in the Char Dham pilgrimage. Revered by Shaivites, Vaishnavites, and Smartas alike, the temple is renowned for its spiritual significance, architectural grandeur, and mythological associations with Lord Rama.
  </p>

  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>
    The temple is situated in the town of Rameswaram, connected to mainland India via the Pamban Bridge. It lies on the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal. The temple’s proximity to the sea adds to its serene and sacred atmosphere.
  </p>

  <h2>Historical Background</h2>
  <p>
    The temple’s origins trace back to ancient times, with references in the Ramayana and Shiva Purana. It was expanded during the 12th century by the Pandya dynasty and later renovated by the Jaffna kings of Sri Lanka. The current structure was developed over centuries, with significant contributions from the Sethupathi rulers of Ramanathapuram.
  </p>

  <h2>Mythological Significance</h2>
  <p>
    According to legend, Lord Rama worshipped Lord Shiva here to atone for killing Ravana, a Brahmin king. Rama instructed Hanuman to bring a lingam from Kailash, but when Hanuman was delayed, Sita created a lingam from sand. Rama worshipped this lingam, now known as Ramalingam, and placed Hanuman’s lingam, Vishvalingam, beside it. Tradition dictates that Vishvalingam is worshipped first.
